I started in Ruby, because I know it best, but as it came into higher order functions in Chapter 8 - “Lambda the Ultimate” - I decided to switch to a language with first-class functions.  Lua, at first, but then chose JavaScript, using NodeJS, since it's more important to keep my JavaScript chops up.

Now I'm glad I did it this way, because I'm making myself solve the problems all over again, a few days after doing it the first time, but from memory, which is surprisingly half-gone already!  Maybe I'll do it again in different languages, some day.
