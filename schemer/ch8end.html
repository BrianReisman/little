		<div class="entry-content"><p>The purpose of <em>The Little Schemer</em>,
 its authors profess, is to teach you to think recursively, and to do so
 without presenting too much math or too many computer science concepts.
 The book is a ball to read. However, from the perspective of this 
reader, who is fairly new to functional programming and totally new to 
Scheme, the book gets almost asymptotically more difficult and 
complicated towards the end of chapter 8, when we hit the function <strong>multirember&amp;co</strong>.
  Looking around on the web, I noticed quite a few people had also hit 
this speed bump and were scratching their heads about how to go on. I 
think I can offer some assistance. So, <a href="http://www.michaelharrison.ws/weblog/?p=31" title="I announce in yesterday's post that I am going to embarrass myself by posting about currying in Scheme">as threatened yesterday</a>,
 I now unveil my initial contribution to the wild world of Lisp, my 
explication of multirember&amp;co and the concept of currying. Here’s 
hoping I don’t embarrass myself too much.</p>
<p><span id="more-34"></span></p>
<p><i>The Little Schemer,</i> (hereafter “TLS”) is the latest iteration of <i>The Little LISPer</i>,
 and is presented as a dialogue between teacher and student. If you take
 the roll of the student, and try to answer the teacher’s questions, 
especially those of the form “define this function whose behavior we’ve 
been describing,” you can really flex your neurons. Each chapter is a 
little more complicated than the previous, and within each chapter the 
questions get slightly harder as you go. It’s like walking up a steadily
 graded hill. Until you get to page 137 and they hit you with a long 
function definition, for a function you’ve never seen before, and they 
ask, “What does this do?”</p>
<p>Yikes!</p>
<p>Here is the code for the function. (Thank you, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.scheme/msg/ee4cb78bb104cf10">Geoffrey King</a>, for transcribing it in your post.)</p>
<pre class="code">(define multirember&amp;co
   (lambda (a lat col)
     (cond
       ((null? lat)
        (col '() '()))
       ((eq? (car lat) a)
        (multirember&amp;co a
                        (cdr lat)
                        (lambda (newlat seen)
                          (col newlat
                               (cons (car lat) seen)))))
       (else
        (multirember&amp;co a
                        (cdr lat)
                        (lambda (newlat seen)
                          (col (cons (car lat) newlat)
                               seen)))))))
</pre>
<p>The first clue to dealing with this function is its context. The 
previous pages of TLS deal with currying, in which you define a function
 like <code>(lambda (x) (lambda(y) (eq? x y) ))</code> — it takes one 
argument, parameter x, and then returns the inner function, which also 
takes one argument, parameter y. The value you pass as x acts to 
customize the inner function by binding the occurance of variable x in 
the inner function to the value you passed in. So chapter 8 is about the
 practice of wrapping functions in this way.</p>
<p>The chapter is also about passing functions as arguments. The first line of multirember&amp;co, <code>(lambda (a lat col)</code>
 defines three parameters. The variables ‘a’ and ‘lat’ are by convention
 used for an atom and a list of atoms. But ‘col’ is a function–you have 
to pass multirember&amp;co a function that it uses inside its own 
definition.</p>
<p>TLS admits that multirember&amp;co is complicated. “That looks really
 complicated!” says the student. But it seeks to simplify the function 
by defining functions to stand in for a) the function that will be 
passed as ‘col’; b) the first inner function defined in the <code>cond</code> branch <code>(eq? (car lat) a)</code>; and c) the inner function defined in the <code>cond else</code>
 branch. To try to make you feel better about being up to your eyelids 
in deep water, the TLS authors give their functions friendly names, like
 “a-friend” and “next-friend.” But I prefer names that tell me what roll
 the functions play, so here are my renamed functions:</p>
<p>a) the function that will be passed initially as ‘col’ (and will be executed last):<br>
<code>(define last-function<br>
  (lambda(x y) (length x)))</code></p>
<p>b) the function called when a matches (car lat):<br>
<code>(define when-match<br>
  (lambda (newlat seen) (col newlat (cons (car lat) seen)))<br>
</code></p>
<p>c) the function called when the cond else branch executes:<br>
<code>(define when-differ<br>
  (lambda (newlat seen) (col (cons (car lat) newlat) seen))</code></p>
<p>TLS walks you through an execution of multirember&amp;co, and so will
 I. To further simplify things, and reduce the amount of typing I have 
to do, I’ll change the example in the book. Instead of a four-word lat 
with some longer words, let’s use (berries tuna fish) for our list, and 
we’ll keep tuna as our atom argument.</p>
<p>Here’s multirember&amp;co, with the two inner functions replaced by the pre-defined helper functions:</p>
<pre class="code">(define multirember&amp;co
   (lambda (a lat col)
     (cond
       ((null? lat)
        (col '() '()))
       ((eq? (car lat) a)
        (multirember&amp;co a
                        (cdr lat)
                        (when-match)))
       (else
        (multirember&amp;co a
                        (cdr lat)
                        (when-differ))))))
</pre>
<p>When the function is called the first time, <code>a</code> is tuna, <code>lat</code> is (berries tuna fish), and <code>col</code>
 is last-function. (car lat) is berries, which does NOT eq tuna, so the 
else branch executes: multirember&amp;co is called with tuna as <code>a</code>, (tuna fish) as <code>lat</code> because we pass <code>(cdr lat)</code> and so we lose the berries atom at the front of the list, and when-differ as <code>col</code>.</p>
<p>But wait. Actually, we’re not just passing the when-differ function we defined above. Here is that definition:</p>
<p><code>(lambda (newlat seen) (col (cons (car lat) newlat) seen))</code></p>
<p>This definition contains a variable, lat, that has a value at the 
time multirember&amp;co is called recursively: (berries tuna fish). So <code>(car lat)</code> is <code>(quote berries)</code>. What we’ve got here is a version, or an instance, of when-differ that has a value bound to one of its variables.</p>
<p>This is like currying, this binding of values to the variable of a 
function and then using this altered function to do something. I think 
that currying, however, refers to wrapping functions so that only one 
variable at a time is given a value. What this apparent creation of a 
specific instance of the function when-differ DOES have in common with 
currying is this: both use <strong>closures</strong> to encapsulate the 
instance of the function with bound variables, or, to be precise, to 
make a copy of the function with its own scope that will persist so long
 as there are references to the closure. I didn’t realize this on my 
own, of course. I owe this insight to Richard P. Gabriel’s essay The Why
 of Y, which you can <a href="http://www.ddj.com/windows/199200394" title="Richard P. Gabriel's essay The Why of Y">read in this Dr. Dobb’s article</a> or <a title="Richard P. Gabriel's The Why of Y, in PDF format" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dreamsongs.com%2FFiles%2FWhyOfY.pdf&amp;ei=1OixRt7zFaCiec-iyAc&amp;usg=AFQjCNHONKt4Cic6Cr2lVBs-PxnC7Xw45Q&amp;sig2=BhkMwJhB-8-lao-dU1H2Dw">download as a PDF</a>.</p>
<p>There’s something else in <code>when-differ</code> that will bind to a value: <code>col</code>. The function passed, remember, is last-function. So we can (and should) substitute that in for <code>col</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s give a unique name to the instance (technically the closure) of
 the function when-differ that has these two values bound to it: <strong>when-differ-1</strong>. Let’s write it out, and set it aside for later use:</p>
<p><code>(define when-differ-1<br>
(lambda (newlat seen) (<strong>last-function</strong> (cons <strong>(quote berries)</strong> newlat) seen))<br>
)</code></p>
<p>Now, on to iteration two, which we can summarize like this:<br>
<code>(multirember&amp;co (quote tuna) (tuna fish) when-differ-1)</code></p>
<p>OK, so this time, <code>(eq? (car lat) a)</code> yields true, and the other branch of the <code>cond</code>executes: multirember&amp;co is called with tuna as <code>a</code>, (fish) as <code>lat</code>, and when-match as <code>col</code>. Once again, thanks to currying, the definition of when-match contains expressions to which values are bound:<code>(car lat)</code>, which becomes <code>(quote tuna) </code>,
 and col, which becomes when-differ-1. Remember, we just recurred by 
calling multirember&amp;co with when-differ-1 as the function argument 
for the parameter <code>col</code>.  So now let’s define the resulting instance of when-match as <strong>when-match-1</strong>:</p>
<p><code>(define when-match-1<br>
  (lambda (newlat seen) (when-differ-1 newlat (cons (quote tuna) seen)))<br>
)</code></p>
<p>On on to iteration three–we’re nearly there–which we can summarize like this:<br>
<code>(multirember&amp;co (quote tuna) (fish) when-match-1)</code></p>
<p>This time, tuna and fish don’t match, which means we’re going to recur with another version of when-differ, <strong>when-differ-2</strong>:</p>
<p><code>(define when-differ-2<br>
  (lambda (newlat seen) (when-match-1 (cons (quote fish) newlat) seen))<br>
)</code></p>
<p>Finally, iteration four:<br>
<code>(multirember&amp;co (quote tuna) () when-differ-2)</code></p>
<p>This time <code>lat</code> is an empty list, which means (null? lat) is true, and the terminating line <code>(col (quote()) (quote())) </code> is executed. Yay! We’re done!</p>
<p>Except…</p>
<p>The result of the completed execution <code>(col (quote()) (quote())) </code> has to be evaluated. Here’s where everything turns inside out, or rightside out if you like.</p>
<p>First of all, the value of <code>col</code> in the final iteration was when-differ-2. So we’ll start there.</p>
<p><code>(when-differ-2 (quote()) (quote()))</code></p>
<p>Now, look back up and get the definition of when-differ-2 and substitute it.<br>
<code>((lambda (newlat seen) (when-match-1 (cons (quote fish) newlat) seen)) (quote()) (quote()))</code></p>
<p>OK, so the parameters <code>newlat</code> and <code>seen</code> both get assigned the value of an empty list:<br>
<code>(when-match-1 (cons (quote fish) (quote())) (quote()))</code></p>
<p>We can simplify this by consing fish onto the empty list:<br>
<code>(when-match-1 (fish) (quote()))</code></p>
<p>We have a definition for when-match-1 too. Let’s substitute that in now.<br>
<code>((lambda (newlat seen) (when-differ-1 newlat (cons (quote tuna) seen))) (fish) (quote())) )</code></p>
<p>And again assign values, this time (fish) and () to newlat and seen:<br>
<code>(when-differ-1 (fish) (tuna))</code></p>
<p>We’re getting somewhere now. Do you see how at each step we’re consing a value onto either <code>seen</code> or <code>newlat</code>? <code>seen</code> has gotten the instance of tuna, which was the atom we passed to multirember&amp;co at the start, whereas <code>newlat</code> has gotten the other atom, fish. Guess where berries is going to go when we get to it.</p>
<p>Now, let’s substitute our definition of when-differ-1:<br>
<code>((lambda (newlat seen) (last-function (cons (quote berries) newlat) seen))  (fish) (tuna))</code></p>
<p>Which becomes….<br>
<code>(last-function (berries fish) (tuna) )</code></p>
<p>And now we’re back where we started, with last-function.</p>
<p><code>( (lambda(x y) (length x)) (berries fish) (tuna) )</code></p>
<p><code>(length (berries fish) )</code></p>
<p><code>2</code></p>
<p>So that’s how multirember&amp;co works. What does it accomplish? It seems to separate occurrences of the atom <code>a</code> in the list of atoms <code>lat</code> from the other atoms in <code>lat</code>, and then it executes last-function using the list of occurrences and the list of other atoms.</p>
<p>In an imperative language like C or Java, you would probably define 
two variables, one for each list, and then loop through the list of 
atoms, testing each element in the list for equality with <code>a</code>,
 and then pushing the element onto either of the two lists. Finally, you
 would call the final function with the two lists you built.</p>
<p>Consider the differences in this approach. Throughout the loop, you 
have several variables remaining in scope, which means you have an 
opportunity to munge one of them accidentally. Also, how modular is this
 hypothetical code? In C, you could pass the last-function function as 
an argument to a procedure that encapsulates the loop, but try it in 
Java. No sir, in Java you’d have to call a method to get the two lists 
(which would have to come back wrapped into one object, probably a <code>String[]</code> array) and then call last-function with <code>returnval[0]</code> and <code>returnval[1]</code>. Not terrible, but not elegant either.</p>
<p>That’s just scratching the surface, I’m sure. If the example were 
more complicated, other implications of the recursive approach might 
become clear, at least to smarter people than me. But there is one other
 thing to point out.</p>
<p>As TLS points out, the function you supply for use with the two lists is assigned to a parameter names <code>col</code>
 because “col” stands for “collector” by convention. What is this 
function collecting? The two lists, of course. But more than that each 
use of <code>col</code>, as it changes from when-differ to when-match, 
is persisting the values of the lists from one step to the next. And 
that’s important because as of page 136, there has been no mention in 
TLS of an assignment operator. So even if we wanted to define variables 
to reference while looping through the list, we could not. Not yet. 
After all, such code would produce what functional programmers refer to,
 with a sniff, as side effects.</p>
